# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




- **Header**: Includes navigation links to different parts of the website.
- **Product Display**: Lists plant products with options to view more details or add them to the cart.
- **Filter Section**: Allows users to filter products based on categories like plant type, price, and more.
- **Cart System**: Adds products to the cart and calculates totals.
- **Routing**: Uses `react-router-dom` to navigate between different pages like the home page, product details, and a thank you page.
- **Scroll to Top**: Automatically scrolls the page to the top when navigating between routes.
